    <h1>Stop the mockery over Larnaca marina, says protestors</h1>
    <p class="date">1 February 2026</p>
    <p>Protestors gathered outside Larnaca marina on Saturday demanding an end to development delays. According to organizers, over 200 people attended the demonstration calling for immediate action on the stalled project.</p>
    <p>The Larnaca marina development has been delayed for years, frustrating local businesses and residents who were promised improvements. Saturday's protest saw participants holding signs demanding accountability from local authorities.</p>
    <p>"We've been waiting for too long," said Maria Georgiou, one of the organizers. "The marina could be a major tourist attraction, but instead it sits neglected."</p>
    <p>Local authorities have promised to address the concerns but provided no specific timeline for resuming work on the marina project.</p>
