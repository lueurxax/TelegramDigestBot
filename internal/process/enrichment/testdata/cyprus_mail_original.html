    <h1>Stop the mockery over Larnaca marina, says protestors</h1>
    <p class="byline">By Cyprus Mail Staff | Published: February 1, 2026</p>
    <p>About 200 people protested outside the Larnaca marina on Saturday, demanding authorities end delays on the marina development project. The protest was organized by local residents who say they have been waiting years for promised improvements.</p>
    <p>Protestors held banners reading "Stop the mockery" and "We want our marina" as they gathered near the waterfront. The demonstration lasted approximately two hours.</p>
    <p>Maria Georgiou, spokesperson for the protest organizers, told Cyprus Mail that the community has lost patience with repeated delays. "Every year we hear promises, but nothing happens. The marina could transform Larnaca's tourism industry."</p>
    <p>The Larnaca marina project was initially approved in 2018 but has faced numerous setbacks including funding disputes and environmental assessments. Local businesses report significant economic losses due to the incomplete facilities.</p>
    <p>A representative from the Larnaca municipality acknowledged the concerns and stated that officials are working to resolve outstanding issues. However, no timeline was provided for resuming construction.</p>
